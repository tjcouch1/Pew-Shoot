# Pew-Shoot
A 1.5-hour game jam asteroid breaking game, updated and published

I made this in a little game competition I had with my friend on August 8, 2014.

.5 Hours: Assets (Art, sound)
1 Hour: Programming

I tweaked it a bit to make it a finished product and [released it on GameJolt](https://gamejolt.com/games/pew-shoot/31751) later that day.

I updated it to feature one-button controls and crisp graphics. Released for Windows, Android, and HTML5.
